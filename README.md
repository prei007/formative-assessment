# formative-assessment
Demonstrator of formative assessment using AI and Bayesian Networks

## Main idea

1. Student uploads a long answer/short essay to a teacher question. 
2. The answer gets scored by chatGPT along with a verbal feedback aligned with the score. 
3. The score gets used to update a Learner Model, formally a Bayesian Network. 
4. The score, the comment, and the Learner Model go to the teacher.
